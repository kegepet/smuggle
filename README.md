# smuggle
```
some key 1::some value for key 1,,some key 2::another value,,the third key::third value blah blah blah
```
The above snippet is an example of a new data serialization/exchange format I call **smuggle**. It aims to provide a simple and uncluttered alternative to the now-ubiquitous JSON and soon-to-be-ubiquitous YAML formats. Unlike those other two, it is one-dimensional and will work with a series of key/value pairs. In other words, no complex data stuctures, no nesting--just variables.
